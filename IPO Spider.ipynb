Introduction\n\n350+ companies and counting have IPO'd on U.S. exchanges in 2020, the highest number since 2000, including big names like Palantir, Asana, Snowflake, and McAfee. Others like Airbnb, Doordash, Instacart, and Robinhood are in the bullpen. It would be great to see what these companies are all about, learn their key products, and to have that info in one place.\n\nTo source info, let's look at the public website https://stockanalysis.com/ipos/2020-list/. We'll build a simple web spider that will scrape the links to each company on the site, follow each company link, scrape each company's description, and output a dictionary with keys as company names & tickers and values as company descriptions. We'll then convert the dictionary that the spider generated into a styled dataframe. We'll create the web spider using scrapy and use both xpath and css methods to access html elements. The heart of the spider are its two parsing methods using css to access html elements - the first to extract links that the spider will follow and the second to scrape the company name & ticker and company description from the new site for each company. Constructing the parsing methods requires time upfront to inspect the site's html in order to get the right css selector for the target html elements. The purpose is to demonstrate how to build a web spider and to create a single table of high-level company descriptions for prospective investors. Future potential areas of scraping, for anyone interested, includes financial detail, including revenue, EBITDA, and free cash flow. "

Our proprietary extended release drug-delivery system is designed to provide an extended period of post-surgical pain relief without the need for repeated dose administration while reducing the potential need for the use of opiates. Our strategy is to incorporate generic drugs with our proprietary extended release drug-delivery system in order to create extended release drug products and to take advantage of the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway created by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d). The 505(b)(2) new drug application (\u201cNDA\u201d) process, provides for FDA approval of a new drug based in part on data that was developed by others, including published literature references and data previously reviewed by the FDA in its approval of a separate application. Using this pathway can significantly reduce the future time and costs associated with clinical development. PRF-110, our first product, is based on the local anesthetic ropivacaine, targeting the post-operative pain relief market. PRF-110 is an oil-based, viscous, clear solution that is deposited directly into the surgical wound bed prior to closure to provide localized and extended post-operative analgesia.',\n 'Applied UV, Inc.

Our proprietary extended release drug-delivery system is designed to provide an extended period of post-surgical pain relief without the need for repeated dose administration while reducing the potential need for the use of opiates. Our strategy is to incorporate generic drugs with our proprietary extended release drug-delivery system in order to create extended release drug products and to take advantage of the 505(b)(2) regulatory pathway created by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (\u201cFDA\u201d). The 505(b)(2) new drug application (\u201cNDA\u201d) process, provides for FDA approval of a new drug based in part on data that was developed by others, including published literature references and data previously reviewed by the FDA in its approval of a separate application. Using this pathway can significantly reduce the future time and costs associated with clinical development. PRF-110, our first product, is based on the local anesthetic ropivacaine, targeting the post-operative pain relief market. PRF-110 is an oil-based, viscous, clear solution that is deposited directly into the surgical wound bed prior to closure to provide localized and extended post-operative analgesia.</td>\n            </tr>\n            <tr>\n                        <th id=\"T_e959cc3a_19f5_11eb_ac30_7915fc5bdaadlevel0_row213\" class=\"row_heading level0 row213\" >Applied UV, Inc.
